# Scientific Computing with C++

These are my courseworks of my undergraduate module MATH4063 *Scientific Computing with C++* in University of Nottingham. The coursework1 allowed us to build from scratch a 2D finite difference solver to solve a PDE boundary value problem. In coursework2, I implement numerical algorithms for approximating second-order initial value problems and then use them to approximate a range of sencond-order system. In the end of the coursework2, I successfully use numerical method to approximate the trajectory of the solar system and estimate the length of cpu time it would take for me to compute trajectories of approximately all stars in our galaxy with the numerical algorithms.

My final marks of this module(2 courseworks and 1 class test) is 90.There may be some mistakes in my codes and solution because these are what I used to submit for grading
